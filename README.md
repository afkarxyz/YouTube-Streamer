### Function explanation

- If you leave the Rename field blank, it defaults to **“Streamer”**
- If you leave the Loop field blank, it defaults to Unlimited
- **Limited to 10 streams,** because the size per window is 480x350 with a 4x4 grid *( if you want more, please change it yourself in the .py code )*
