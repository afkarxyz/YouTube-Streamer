# YouTube Streamer
YouTube Streamer is a lightweight tool for simultaneously streaming to multiple YouTube channels without high computer specs, as it doesn't require video encoding.

The program is portable and does not require admin permissions, suitable for running anywhere, even with low RDP specs. The important thing is high internet speed.

**Function explanation**

- If you leave the Rename field blank, it defaults to **“Streamer”**
- If you leave the Loop field blank, it defaults to Unlimited
- **Limited to 10 streams,** because the size per window is 480x350 with a 4x3 grid *(if you want more, please change it yourself in the .py code)*
